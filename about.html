                    <h2>Strengthening Student Government in Medical Education</h2>
                    <p>NMSGA exists to solve a problem unique to student government: complete leadership turnover every year. When a new student body president takes office, they inherit the role with little institutional memory. Solutions that worked are forgotten. Mistakes are repeated. Each new leader starts from scratch.</p>
                    <p>We provide the infrastructure to change that. Through peer networks, shared resources, and preserved institutional knowledge, NMSGA ensures that student government leaders can build on the work of those who came before — across schools and across time.</p>

                        <p>A group of student body presidents from eight medical schools met informally at a national conference. They discovered they were all solving the same problems independently — and wondered why no network existed to connect them.</p>
